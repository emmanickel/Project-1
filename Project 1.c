/* Project Planning:

Task 1: Encryption with a rotation cipher given plain text and key

Task 2: Decryption with a rotation cipher given cipher text and key

Task 3: Encryption with a substitution ciper given plain text and key

Task 4: Decryption with a substitution cipher given cipher text and key

Task 5: Decryption of a previously unseen cipher text encrypted with a rotation cipher

Task 6: Decryption of a day-1 provided block of cipher text encrypted with a substitution cipher

Task 7: Decryption of an unseen block of cipher text on marking day
